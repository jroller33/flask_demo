# Flask testing app

I'm using this repo to learn how [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) works, then I'm going to start building a backend for my [React.js Barcode Generator](https://github.com/jroller33/Barcode-Generator) using Flask and Python.

Next Steps:
- Add bootstrap to Flask?
- Learn how to deploy basic Flask app to Azure. Barcode Generator will be moved from GH Pages to Azure once it's completed.
- Learn how to use react.js with Flask and Python, instead of Flask's templating engine
